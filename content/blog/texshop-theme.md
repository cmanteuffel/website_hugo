I love writing using Markdown and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/de/writer) because of its appealing UI and its focus on nothing but the content.
Yet, when it comes to writing scientific articles the missing support for citations and cross-referencing draws me back to LaTeX. 

My editor-of-choice is [TexShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) which works well for me, except, the default color scheme makes it exhausting to work for long hours due to the bright colors, hard contrasts and small font. That's why I tried to immitate the visuals of iA Writer in TexShop.

Here is the catch: TexShop is rather limited when it comes to theming. It is only possible to define a few colors and the general font. To truly mimick iA Writer, it would also be necessary to define a different font-face for various elements. Moreover, iA Writer uses a font called [*Nitti Light*](https://www.boldmonday.com/typeface/nitti/), which is not available for free. Luckily, [someone found](https://plus.google.com/+GerdKortuem/posts/NZazy3hM37j) the Google Font [*Cousine*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine) to be a good free alternative. 

Given the limitations of TexShop, I am pleased with the result. 
![Make TexShop look like iA Writer](img/texshop_iawriter_theme.png)

If you want to make TexShop look a little bit more like iA Writer perform the following steps:

1. In *TexShop Preferences* set the document font to **16pt** **Nitti** or [**Cousine**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine) .
1. Execute the following commands in the OS X Terminal.app or [download the sourcefile from Gist](https://gist.github.com/cmanteuffel/ff53c0ac251089369a310eeaec301fb7). The colors are based on the *Digital Color Meter* and [this blog post](http://hypertext.net/2011/06/mimic-writer-aesthetic/).
