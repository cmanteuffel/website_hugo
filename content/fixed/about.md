Hi. I am Christian Manteuffel. 

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the [Software Engineering and Architecture group](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search) of the [University of Groningen](http://rug.nl).

My primary interests are **software architecture**, **engineering of software-intensive systems**,  **architecture decisions**, **patterns**, and simply good software design. 

I am an experienced software designer and developer, with a strong background in Java and C#. I am the driving force behind several [projects](/projects), worked as a freelancer iOS developer and gained experience in Eclipse plugin development as an intern at the ITEMIS AG. 

Climbing, Mountaineering, Running, Fitness, 

I am member in IEEE, ACM, DAV
