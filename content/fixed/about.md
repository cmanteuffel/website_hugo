Hi. I am Christian Manteuffel. 

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the [Software Engineering and Architecture group](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search) of the [University of Groningen](http://rug.nl).

My primary interests are **software architecture**, **engineering of software-intensive systems**,  **architecture decisions**, **patterns (of all sorts)**, and simply good software design. 

I am an experienced software designer and developer, with a strong background in Java and C#. I am the driving force behind several [projects](/projects), worked as a freelance iOS developer and gained experience in Eclipse plugin development as an intern at the ITEMIS AG. 


During my carreer I have (co-)supervised various master, bachelor and internship projects, gave lectures in software architecture and software patterns and have worked as a teaching assistent in multiple bachelor and master-level courses.
